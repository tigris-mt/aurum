# Base Gameplay
* Mobs
	* Farming
	* Taming
	* Hostile
	* NPC
* Teleportation
	* Each block in Aurum and the Horti is connected to a psuedorandom block in the Loom (probably on the same Y level).
		* By building portals to the Loom or from the Loom to each specific realm, you can travel between them all.
	* The Aether is connected similiarly to the Loom, but in proportion rather than randomly.

# Extended Gameplay
* Dye
* Moreblocks or similiar
* Doors
* Flight
* Hand swapping
* Awards
* Automation/circuits

# Random Ideas
* Karma system
	* Adds new "karma" armor group, bad karma gives you a vulnerability.
	* To offset this, bad karma may be a requirement to use some powerful pysche spells or similiar.
* Add sychophants (some kind of mob) to the jungles.

# Outer Realms - See design/overview.md
* The Loom
	* Node-based "worm" "mob" that eats blocks.
		* Heckweaver, eats nodes and leaves behind Heck.
	* Always day (override player time and minetest.get_node_light).
* Ultimus Hortum
	* Portions of Ultimus are touched by the Loom, portals betweeb the two can be found naturally.
	* City biome, crumbling buildings and skyscrapers.
	* This is the fallen portion of the previous world abandoned by its titan.
