## World Layout
### Seven Planes
* Aurum (gold, metal) in the center. The Material Plane.
* The Aether (light) above.
* The Loom (dark, twisting) below.
* Inferno (flame, power) to the north.
* Abyss (cold, stasis) to the south.
* The Ancient Roots (nature, growth) to the east.
* The Fleeting Fell (psyche, decay) to the west.

## Game Goals
* Variety of environments between the seven planes.
* NPCs, villages, discoverable lore.
* Progression through actions such as mining or defeating mobs.
	* This will grant "mana" to be used in upgrading items and personal attributes or charging rods.
* Story progression through conquering the seven planes.
	* Conquering each plane (in some various manner) will grant you a "crown jewel" with appropriate properties.
	* The jewels can be combined into a crown. Wearing it on a throne in the Aether will win the game.
