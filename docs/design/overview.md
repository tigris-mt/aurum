## World Layout
### Realms
* Aurum: Standard green world with stone and ore. Green and grey.
* The Loom: Twisted version of Aurum, filled with hostility and strange materials. Red and orange.
* The Aether: Landmass floating on the void (no underground). White and gold. The realm of Hyperion.
* Primus Hortum: The vortex of natural life, filled with decay and new growth to no end. Dark green and brown.
* Ultimus Hortum: The remains of the ancient world, a frozen wasteland filled with the spectres of the past. Very little life. Blue and black.

## Game Goals
* Variety of environments between the realms.
* NPCs, villages, discoverable lore.
* Progression through actions such as mining or defeating mobs.
	* This will grant "mana" to be used in upgrading items and personal attributes or charging rods.
* Story progression through conquering the seven planes.
	* Conquering each plane (in some various manner) will grant you a "crown jewel" with appropriate properties.
	* The jewels can be combined into a crown. Wearing it on a throne in the Aether will win the game.
