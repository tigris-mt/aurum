## General Goals
In their [forum post](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=19023#p305711), Wuzzy outlined a few interesting goals to achieve for general games to be included in minetest.

* Past alpha stage (completion).
* More than 6 hours of play.
* No obvious/breaking/super-annoying bugs or crashes.
* Help system (manual, in-game help, etc.)
* FOSS
* Stable worlds and APIs.

## World Layout
### Seven Planes
* Aurum (gold, metal) in the center. The Material Plane.
* The Aether (light) above.
* The Loom (dark, twisting) below.
* Inferno (flame, power) to the north.
* Abyss (cold, stasis) to the south.
* The Ancient Roots (nature, growth) to the east.
* The Fleeting Fell (psyche, decay) to the west.
