# Random Ideas

	* To offset this, bad karma may be a requirement to use some powerful pysche spells or similiar.
* Add sychophants (some kind of mob) to the jungles.

# Outer Realms - See design/overview.md
* Ultimus Hortum
	* Portions of Ultimus are touched by the Loom, portals betweeb the two can be found naturally.
	* City biome, crumbling buildings and skyscrapers.
	* This is the fallen portion of the previous world abandoned by its titan.
* Aether
	* Precise teleportation within the Aether possible.
